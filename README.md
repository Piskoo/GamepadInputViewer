# UMPAnUMiW-Projekt-GamepadInputViewer
GamepadInputViewer is an application for Windows devices. It allows you to check the correct operation of your HID gamepad device. The programme allows simultaneous switching between four connected devices. Devices can be manually selected or, if the 'connect to first available' option is selected, the application arbitrarily selects one of the devices for data capture.

The application allows you to choose between data capture modes. The available options are:

- XInput
- DirectInput
- RawInput

The characteristic feature of XInput and DirectInput is the analogue trigger. RawInput, on the other hand, allows additional axes to be displayed; for the purposes of the project, the additional axes are treated as a gyroscope.
